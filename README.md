# MarsExplorer

### Comments

  * I didnt considered the limit area due to lack of time, but the app is prepared for working with them, just a small update is needed.
  * I tried to make the solution visible in a graphic.
  * Also, if you try to add command for only 1 rover, it raises an error. I didnt verified it but could easily do.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
